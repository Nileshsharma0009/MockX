Modern merchant ships now use AI-driven navigation systems to predict storms, optimize fuel efficiency, and detect machinery faults before they become dangerous. However, many aspiring seafarers are unaware of both the strengths and limitations of AI. While automation increases safety, excessive reliance on technology may weaken a navigator’s independent judgment. Therefore, maritime training institutes must ensure that cadets learn how to use AI responsibly without ignoring traditional seamanship skills. AI should serve as a supportive tool, not as a substitute for human expertise at sea.",
