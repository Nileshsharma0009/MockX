    q: "Will I get access to new tests added after my purchase?",
    a: "Yes! When you buy a test series for a specific exam (e.g., JEE 2026), you are entitled to all future updates for that session. If our experts add 5 more 'Full-Length Mocks' or 'Special Revision Tests' next month, they will automatically appear in your dashboard at no extra cost."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you provide detailed solutions or just the answer keys?",
    a: "Every single question on MockX comes with a step-by-step pedagogical solution. We don't just tell you that 'Option B' is correct; we explain the concept behind it, the formulas used, and often provide 'Short-Cut Tricks' to help you solve similar problems faster during the actual exam."
  },
  {
    q: "What if I face a technical issue during a live mock test?",
    a: "Our platform features an 'Auto-Save' mechanism. If your internet disconnects or your device shuts down, your progress is saved instantly. You can log back in from any device and resume exactly where you left off. We also have a dedicated technical support team available via chat to resolve any glitches within minutes."
  },
  {
    q: "How does the 'Rank Predictor' work?",
    a: "Our algorithm compares your performance against thousands of other aspirants taking the same mock test. It calculates a 'Percentile Score' based on the difficulty of the paper and the average marks scored by the community, giving you a realistic projection of where you stand in the national-level competition."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I re-attempt the mock tests?",
    a: "While we recommend taking a mock test once with full seriousness to get an accurate rank, you can re-attempt any test to practice your weak areas. Additionally, you have lifetime access to the 'Review Mode,' where you can go through every question, your marked answer, and the correct solution as many times as you like."
